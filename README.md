# Algo Visualizer

An interactive React pathfinding visualizer that implements Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* (A-Star). Build your own grid by adding walls and edge weights to certain nodes, and choose your start and end nodes. Then watch the algorithm find the shortest path in real-time.

## Features

- Interactive 20x20 grid
- Visualizes:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search Algorithm
- User interaction:
  - Manually set start and end nodes
  - Add or remove walls
  - Enable weighted mode to increase path cost (edge weights)
- Random start/end node generation
- Clear/reset board functionality
- Bootstrap UI elements

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
